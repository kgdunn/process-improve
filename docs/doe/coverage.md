## `evaluate_design` Metrics

All 14 metrics live in `experiments/evaluate.py` behind the `_METRIC_REGISTRY`:

| Metric | Function | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| D-efficiency | `_compute_d_efficiency` | `100 · det(X'X)^(1/p) / N`; 100 for orthogonal full factorials. |
| I-efficiency | `_compute_i_efficiency` | `100 · p / (N · mean prediction variance over a Sobol grid)`. |
| G-efficiency | `_compute_g_efficiency` | `100 · p / (N · max prediction variance over a Sobol grid)`. |
| Prediction variance | `_compute_prediction_variance` | Leverage `x'(X'X)⁻¹x` evaluated on a Sobol grid. |
| VIF | `_compute_vif` | Per-term variance inflation factors (excluding intercept). |
| Condition number | `_compute_condition_number` | `numpy.linalg.cond(X)`. |
| Power | `_compute_power` | Non-central F; scalar or curve over effect sizes. |
| Degrees of freedom | `_compute_degrees_of_freedom` | Breakdown: model / residual / total / pure error / lack-of-fit. |
| Alias structure | `_compute_alias_structure` | GF(2) closure for fractional factorials; correlation fallback for other designs. |
| Confounding | `_compute_confounding` | Extracted from alias chains. |
| Resolution | `_compute_resolution` | Minimum word length in the defining relation. |
| Defining relation | `_compute_defining_relation` | Full closure under GF(2) multiplication. |
| Clear effects | `_compute_clear_effects` | Effects whose aliases are all higher-order. |
| Minimum aberration | `_compute_minimum_aberration` | Wordlength pattern (A_3, A_4, …). |

## Caveats

- **DSD conference matrix.** `_conference_matrix` in `designs_response_surface.py` uses Paley's construction when `m − 1` is an odd prime (covers `m ∈ {4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30, 32, 38, 42, 44, 48, 54, 60, 62, 68, 72, 74, 80, 84, 90, 98, …}`). For other *m* (including `m ∈ {10, 16, 22, 26, 28, 34, 36, 40, 46, 50, 52, 56, …}`) the function falls back to a cyclic approximation that does **not** satisfy `Cᵀ C = (m − 1) I`, and logs a warning. Main-effects orthogonality of the resulting DSD may be degraded in those sizes.
- **Optimal designs without `pyoptex`.** D-optimal has a point-exchange fallback; I/A-optimal raise `ImportError` instead. Hard-to-change factors (split-plot structure) are currently ignored with a `logger.warning` when `pyoptex` is not available.
- **Taguchi OA auto-selection** picks the smallest standard array that covers the requested factor count and level counts, but the underlying `pyDOE3.taguchi_design` requires the number of `levels_per_factor` entries to match the OA column count exactly, so requesting a Taguchi design with fewer factors than any available OA will fail. Users typically pick *k* to match one of the standard arrays (3, 4, 7, 11, 15, …).

## Reliance on `pyoptex`

`pyoptex` (github.com/mborn1/pyoptex) powers the high-quality optimal designs
(D/I/A-optimal coordinate exchange and split-plot structures) in
`designs_optimal.py`. It is an **optional, undeclared** dependency: the core
install never pulls it in, and the integration degrades cleanly when it is
absent (D-optimal falls back to point exchange; I/A-optimal raise a clear
`ImportError`; hard-to-change factors are ignored with a warning). This keeps
our coupling to a single, well-isolated adapter module.

We deliberately keep that coupling loose, for two reasons.

- **Release cadence.** `pyoptex` is updated infrequently. The compatibility fix
  that lets it coexist with our `plotly>=6.5.2` (loosened `plotly`/`pandas`/
  `scikit-learn` pins, upstream PR #49) is merged but not yet released to PyPI;
  the latest release (`pyoptex==1.2.1`) still pins `plotly~=5.24` and therefore
  cannot be resolved alongside our stack. Until a compatible release ships,
  `pyoptex` cannot be added to the `expt`/`all` extras without breaking the
  `uv sync --all-extras` resolution that CI relies on.
- **Where the value lives.** The slice we use (`doe/fixed_structure`) is
  Cython-compiled (the coordinate-exchange optimizer and split-plot formula
  evaluation ship as C extensions). Vendoring it is permitted (`pyoptex` is
  BSD-3-Clause) but would add a C build toolchain to an otherwise pure-Python
  package and hand us the maintenance of numerically delicate optimizer code.
  The current friction is a packaging release lag, not a code problem, so
  vendoring is the wrong trade.

**How the gated tests still get exercised.** Because the main CI job never
installs `pyoptex`, the `@_skip_no_pyoptex` tests would skip everywhere. A
dedicated, **non-blocking** `test-with-pyoptex` job in `run-tests.yml` installs
`pyoptex` from git `main` (PR #49) on top of the normal sync and runs the
optimal-design tests, so the real `pyoptex` paths get coverage without coupling
core resolution to an unreleased upstream. If upstream main breaks, that job
goes yellow, never red.

**Exit criterion.** Once `pyoptex` publishes a `plotly>=6`-compatible release,
move it into the `expt`/`all` extras as a normal pinned dependency and promote
the `test-with-pyoptex` job to a blocking check. If `pyoptex` instead goes
unmaintained, the clean replacement is to write a minimal coordinate-exchange
for I/A-optimal in numpy (reusing the existing `point_exchange` pattern in
`optimal.py`), not to transplant the upstream Cython.

## No Silent Fallbacks

`generate_design` does **not** silently substitute a different design type when the requested one is infeasible. Unknown `design_type` values raise `ValueError` in `designs.py:328-331`; individual dispatchers validate their own inputs (e.g. BBD and DSD require `k ≥ 3`). Errors surface through the tool wrapper as `{"error": ...}` and reach agent callers as HTTP 422.
