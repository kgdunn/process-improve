## `evaluate_design` Metrics

All 14 metrics live in `experiments/evaluate.py` behind the `_METRIC_REGISTRY`:

| Metric | Function | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| D-efficiency | `_compute_d_efficiency` | `100 · det(X'X)^(1/p) / N`; 100 for orthogonal full factorials. |
| I-efficiency | `_compute_i_efficiency` | `100 · p / (N · mean prediction variance over a Sobol grid)`. |
| G-efficiency | `_compute_g_efficiency` | `100 · p / (N · max prediction variance over a Sobol grid)`. |
| Prediction variance | `_compute_prediction_variance` | Leverage `x'(X'X)⁻¹x` evaluated on a Sobol grid. |
| VIF | `_compute_vif` | Per-term variance inflation factors (excluding intercept). |
| Condition number | `_compute_condition_number` | `numpy.linalg.cond(X)`. |
| Power | `_compute_power` | Non-central F; scalar or curve over effect sizes. |
| Degrees of freedom | `_compute_degrees_of_freedom` | Breakdown: model / residual / total / pure error / lack-of-fit. |
| Alias structure | `_compute_alias_structure` | GF(2) closure for fractional factorials; correlation fallback for other designs. |
| Confounding | `_compute_confounding` | Extracted from alias chains. |
| Resolution | `_compute_resolution` | Minimum word length in the defining relation. |
| Defining relation | `_compute_defining_relation` | Full closure under GF(2) multiplication. |
| Clear effects | `_compute_clear_effects` | Effects whose aliases are all higher-order. |
| Minimum aberration | `_compute_minimum_aberration` | Wordlength pattern (A_3, A_4, …). |

## Caveats

- **DSD conference matrix.** `_conference_matrix` in `designs_response_surface.py` uses Paley's construction when `m − 1` is an odd prime (covers `m ∈ {4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30, 32, 38, 42, 44, 48, 54, 60, 62, 68, 72, 74, 80, 84, 90, 98, …}`). For other *m* (including `m ∈ {10, 16, 22, 26, 28, 34, 36, 40, 46, 50, 52, 56, …}`) the function falls back to a cyclic approximation that does **not** satisfy `Cᵀ C = (m − 1) I`, and logs a warning. Main-effects orthogonality of the resulting DSD may be degraded in those sizes.
- **Optimal designs without `pyoptex`.** D-optimal has a point-exchange fallback; I/A-optimal raise `ImportError` instead. Hard-to-change factors (split-plot structure) are currently ignored with a `logger.warning` when `pyoptex` is not available.
- **Taguchi OA auto-selection** picks the smallest standard array that covers the requested factor count and level counts, but the underlying `pyDOE3.taguchi_design` requires the number of `levels_per_factor` entries to match the OA column count exactly, so requesting a Taguchi design with fewer factors than any available OA will fail. Users typically pick *k* to match one of the standard arrays (3, 4, 7, 11, 15, …).

## Reliance on `pyoptex`

`pyoptex` (github.com/mborn1/pyoptex) powers the high-quality optimal designs
(D/I/A-optimal coordinate exchange and split-plot structures) in
`designs_optimal.py`. For **end users** it is an optional, undeclared
dependency: the core install never pulls it in, and the integration degrades
cleanly when it is absent (D-optimal falls back to point exchange; I/A-optimal
raise a clear `ImportError`; hard-to-change factors are ignored with a warning
and a `hard_to_change_ignored` metadata flag). This keeps the coupling to a
single, well-isolated adapter module.

**How the gated tests get exercised.** In the uv-managed development
environment, `pyoptex` IS installed: it sits in the `[dependency-groups].dev`
list, and `[tool.uv] override-dependencies` relaxes its over-strict
`plotly~=5.24` and `numba~=0.61` pins to this project's own floors. Every CI
job runs `uv sync --dev --all-extras`, so the pyoptex-backed tests
(`test_designs_optimal_pyoptex.py` and the gated classes in
`test_design_generation.py`) run as blocking checks across the whole matrix.
The no-pyoptex fallback and ImportError paths stay covered too: the tests in
`test_designs_screening_optimal.py` force `_PYOPTEX_AVAILABLE = False` via
monkeypatch instead of relying on the package being absent.

**Why it is still not a published extra.** pip cannot apply uv overrides, so
declaring `pyoptex` in the `expt`/`all` extras would make combinations like
`[expt] + [plotting]` unresolvable for pip users. The upstream fix for the
plotly pin (mborn1/pyoptex#49, `plotly>=5.24,<7`) is merged but not yet in a
PyPI release; `numba~=0.61` is still pinned strictly even upstream. Until a
release ships relaxed pins, end users who want I/A-optimal install `pyoptex`
in a separate environment (`pip install pyoptex`).

**Why not vendor it.** The slice used here (`doe/fixed_structure`) is
Cython-compiled. Vendoring is permitted (`pyoptex` is BSD-3-Clause) but would
add a C build toolchain to an otherwise pure-Python package and transfer the
maintenance of numerically delicate optimizer code. The friction is a
packaging release lag, not a code problem, so vendoring is the wrong trade.

**Exit criterion.** Once `pyoptex` publishes a release with the relaxed pins,
move it into the `expt`/`all` extras as a normal dependency and drop the
`[tool.uv]` overrides (the numba override can only go once upstream relaxes
`numba~=0.61`). If `pyoptex` instead goes unmaintained, the clean replacement
is a minimal numpy coordinate-exchange for I/A-optimal (reusing the existing
`point_exchange` pattern in `optimal.py`), not a transplant of the upstream
Cython.

## No Silent Fallbacks

`generate_design` does **not** silently substitute a different design type when the requested one is infeasible. Unknown `design_type` values raise `ValueError` in `designs.py:328-331`; individual dispatchers validate their own inputs (e.g. BBD and DSD require `k ≥ 3`). Errors surface through the tool wrapper as `{"error": ...}` and reach agent callers as HTTP 422.
