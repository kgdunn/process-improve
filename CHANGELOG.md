## [Unreleased]

## [1.21.6] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- `calculate_cpk` no longer raises a `TypeError` under NumPy 2.x when a
  specification limit is passed as `None` (the limit is estimated from the
  data via `trim_percentile`).
- `c()` no longer raises an `AttributeError` when building a categorical
  factor column from non-numeric values without an explicit `levels`
  argument; the levels are now sorted correctly.

### Removed

- `f_mad` and `f_robust_mad` batch feature functions. Both were
  non-functional: `f_mad` relied on `DataFrameGroupBy.mad()` (removed in
  pandas 2.0, below this project's supported pandas) and `f_robust_mad`
  was an unfinished stub that always raised. The `"mad"` and
  `"robust_mad"` keys are also removed from the batch feature dispatch
  table.

## [1.21.4] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- `CHANGELOG.md` to track notable changes between releases.
- Issue forms for bug reports, feature requests, and questions, plus a pull
  request template, under `.github/`.

## [1.21.3] - 2026-05-17

### Added

- Per-observation diagnostics for PCA and PLS.
- Cross-validation for PLS: component selection and beta-coefficient error
  bars.
- Explained-variance, correlation-loadings, observed-vs-predicted, and
  coefficient plots for PCA and PLS.
- RV and modified RV (RV2) matrix-correlation coefficients.
- `CITATION.cff` so GitHub renders a "Cite this repository" button, and
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development setup, testing, and code-style notes.

### Changed

- Reworked the README with a sharper value proposition and a
  "Why not scikit-learn?" comparison table.
